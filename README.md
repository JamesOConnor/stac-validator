# stac-validator
Python/Flask Validator for the stac-spec

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
    * Flask
    * Requests

## TODO
Here only because we don't have an issue tracker yet.

* Get interface FORM that takes catalog root url or single item to test.
* Recursively crawl catalog
* Pretty Print or better error logging for end user
    * When a json fails to validate the code needs to catch and display those errors to the user.
* Get a deployment running
